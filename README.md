# TicTacToe Game - JavaScript/HTML/CSS
My first project whilst studying at General Assembly was to build on online game - TicTacToe using in JavaScript.

This exercise is to develop working through logic and output simple rules, simple actions, and simple ending configurations. using vanilla JavaScript version, not using dependancies such as jQuery.

## Project Goals
* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the application
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete (bonus: compete from separate devices)
* Craft a readme.md file that explains this app to the world

## The Game 
* Two players (player X, and player O) play on 3x3 grid. 
* Player X is a human player, and player O is an AI. * A player can put his/her letter (either X or O) in an empty cell in the grid. 
* If a player forms a row, a column or a diagonal with his/her letter, that player wins and the game ends. 
* If the grid is full and thereâ€™s no row, column or diagonal of the same letter, the game ends at draw. 
* A player should try to win in the lowest possible number of moves.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

## Installation 
Clone the repo:

```

cd tictactoe2018
```

then follow instructions in the Running section.

## Steps for Running read-only access
To start the python server, run the following via the Command Line:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8000) and take a look around.
